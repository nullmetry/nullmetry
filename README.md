- 👋 Hi, I’m @nullmetry
- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack development, but I also like game dev and, oh man, all computer science is cool
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack and webgame development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects(would love to learn anything new), since I have few experience
